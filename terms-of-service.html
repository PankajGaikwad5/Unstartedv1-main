        <p>Welcome to codedamn. This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile
          services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the
          &quot;Service&quot;). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood,
          and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use
          of your information as set forth in the codedamn Privacy Policy , whether or not you are a
          registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access
          the Service (“Users”). PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH
          PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE
          USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS
          ACTIONS.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="use-of-service">Use of Service</h2>
        <p>codedamn provides an online interactive platform for taking and creating coding classes and video
          lectures.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="eligibility">1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>This is a contract between you and codedamn. You must read and agree to these terms before using
          the codedamn Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You must be 16 years or
          older to use the Services. If you are less than 18 years of age and would like to register to use
          any part of the Services, please ask your parent or legal guardian to review and agree to these
          terms before you use any part of the Services, or ask them to complete the purchase or registration
          on your behalf. Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Services, such as rules for a
          particular competition, promotion, service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain
          content accessible through the Services. Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you
          in connection with such competition, service or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are
          in addition to these terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms. The Service is
          not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by codedamn.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="codedamn-service">2. codedamn Service</h2>
        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive,
          limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal,
          noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. codedamn reserves all rights
          not expressly granted herein in the Service and the codedamn Content (as defined below). codedamn
          may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="codedamn-accounts">3. codedamn Accounts</h2>
        <p>Your codedamn account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and
          maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to codedamn with a third-party
          service (for example, Facebook or Google), you give us permission to access and use your information
          from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that
          service.</p>
        <p>You may never use another User&#x27;s account without permission. When creating your account, you
          must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that
          occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use
          “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and
          symbols) with your account. You must notify codedamn immediately of any breach of security or
          unauthorized use of your account. codedamn will not be liable for any losses caused by any
          unauthorized use of your account.</p>
        <p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in
          your settings page. By providing codedamn your email address you consent to our using the email
          address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of
          communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as
          changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email
          messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your “settings” page. Opting out may prevent
          you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="school-accounts">4. School Accounts</h2>
        <p>The Children&#x27;s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service
          providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from
          children under 13. Because codedamn provides the Service to School to benefit and enhance the
          School&#x27;s curriculum, CODEDAMN RELIES ON SCHOOL TO OBTAIN AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CONSENT, IF
          NEEDED, TO COLLECT STUDENT INFORMATION. School represents and warrants that School has the authority
          to provide consent for codedamn to collect information from students before allowing students under
          13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and
          parents regarding School&#x27;s sharing of Student Data with service providers such as codedamn. We
          recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="service-rules">5. Service Rules</h2>
        <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing,
          or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated
          or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,”
          “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request
          messages to the codedamn servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by
          using a conventional on-line web browser (except that codedamn grants the operators of public search
          engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from codedamn.com for the sole purpose
          of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the
          materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or
          other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or
          security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any
          action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately
          large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software
          agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information,
          including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation
          purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a
          person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with
          the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology
          or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we
          may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that
          prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or
          the content therein.</p>
        <p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the
          Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or
          temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any
          reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for
          no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other codedamn Users. We reserve the right,
          but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. codedamn shall have no
          liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User&#x27;s action or inaction.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="user-content">User Content</h2>
        <p>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments,
          questions, course content and other content or information (any such materials a User submits,
          posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”). Access to these
          features may be subject to age restrictions. We claim no ownership rights over User Content created
          by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the
          Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with
          your settings and this Agreement. codedamn has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole
          discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.</p>
        <p>You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental
          injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you,
          to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any
          person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate
          content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute
          to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful,
          abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or
          publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous,
          threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is
          illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law
          or of another party&#x27;s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not
          have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or
          (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current or (ix) violates
          any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics. You agree that
          any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind,
          including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of
          privacy. codedamn reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content
          that codedamn believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You understand that
          publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S.
          Copyright Office, the Writer&#x27;s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights,
          copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and
          service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now
          exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals
          and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p>
        <p>Your User Content and codedamn&#x27;s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service
          will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any
          Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights. codedamn may exercise the rights to your User
          Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals,
          payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise. To the
          best of your knowledge, all your User Content you provide to us is truthful and accurate. You have
          the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to
          use such person&#x27;s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this
          Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to
          such use. codedamn takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or
          any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for
          your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only
          acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You
          understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable,
          inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that codedamn shall
          not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="user-content-license-grant">User Content License Grant</h2>
        <p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that
          you have all rights necessary to grant, to codedamn a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable,
          perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list
          information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display,
          and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as
          contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether
          now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and codedamn&#x27;s (and
          its successors&#x27; and affiliates&#x27;) business, including without limitation for promoting and
          redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and
          through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license
          to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, display, reproduce and perform such
          User Content solely as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="mobile-software">Mobile Software</h2>
        <h3>1. Mobile Software</h3>
        <p>We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To
          use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Service.
          codedamn does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device.
          codedamn hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled
          code copy of the Mobile Software for one codedamn account on one mobile device owned or leased
          solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse
          engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by
          law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile
          Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services
          for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable,
          damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that
          prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or
          features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and
          other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software. You acknowledge that codedamn may from time
          to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade
          the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such
          automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement
          will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile
          Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing
          use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy
          thereof, and codedamn or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest
          in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights,
          duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void.
          codedamn reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. You agree to comply with
          all Indian and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Software and the codedamn Service.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4 mb-2" id="mobile-software-app-store">2. Mobile Software from App Store</h2>
        <p>The following applies to any Mobile Software you acquire from the App Store (“iTunes-Sourced
          Software”): You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is solely between you and codedamn, not
          Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the iTunes-Sourced Software or content thereof. Your
          use of the iTunes-Sourced Software must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge
          that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect
          to the iTunes-Sourced Software. In the event of any failure of the iTunes-Sourced Software to
          conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price
          for the iTunes-Sourced Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple
          will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software, and
          any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to
          conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to codedamn
          as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims
          of you or any third party relating to the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use of
          the iTunes-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any
          claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
          requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such
          claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to codedamn as provider of the
          software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the iTunes-Sourced
          Software or your possession and use of that iTunes-Sourced Software infringes that third
          party&#x27;s intellectual property rights, codedamn, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
          investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement
          claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and codedamn acknowledge and agree that Apple,
          and Apple&#x27;s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your
          license of the iTunes-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions
          of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
          enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software against you as a
          third party beneficiary thereof.</p>
